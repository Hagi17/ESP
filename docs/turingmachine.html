Compile: g++ -std=c++11 -o tm tmsim.cpp

c++11 is minimum standard.

Usage: ./tm &lt;programfile> [-show] [-in=&lt;input>] [-help] [-exit] [-speed=&lt;steps/sec>] [-I&lt;folder>] [-ext] [-out=&lt;file>]

&lt;programfile>   specifies the path to the Programfile (Ending: .tm, .txt)
-show           print the current tape after each step.
-speed=<>       the time for a step when displaying the tape in steps/sec
-tape           specify input (characters on tape)
-help           show this help
-ext            include internal/read, internal/write and internal/clear
-exit           don't ask for enter at the end of the program.
-in=&lt;file>      set the content of file as input on the tape
-out=&lt;file>     store the input and the final output in the specified file
-I&lt;folder>      Add <folder> to the Machines searchpath for TM - Files

internal/read: interprets the content of the tape until '$' as a filepath
                and loads the content on to the tape behind that $ (ignores \n)
internal/write: interprets the content of the tape until '$' as a filepath
                and stores the tape behind the $ in the file
internal/clear: clear complete tape

from internal/write and internal/read you can go on by reading * or $
from internal/clear by reading * or _

Program-Layout:
[#include "&lt;file>"]
name: &lt;name>
init: &lt;state>
accept: &lt;state>[,&lt;state>]
&lt;state>,&lt;input>,&lt;output>,<move>,<newstate>
\/\/comments will be ignored

#include &lt;file> include a Sub-TM (as many as needed)
Name            indicates the Name of the Program (important when used as Sub-TM).
init            indicates the start State of the Program.
accept          indicates the accepted states of the Program.

The 5-Tupel must be specified for each transition
&lt;state>         current state; any case-sensitive string
&lt;input>         if this single character is read, the transition will be triggered
&lt;output>        single character to be written onto the tape
&lt;move>          Move the Head: < (go left), > (go right) or - (stay)
&lt;newstate>      next state; any case-sensitive string

'*' reads any character, '_' reads an empty field
'*' writes no character, '_' writes an empty field

Sub-TM: for <state>/<newstate> use name/state, where name is the name of the sub-TM
